[11:56] <stoyanr> hi there, anybody figured out what "the vertical distances (y-distance) of the points from that line" means exactly?
[11:57] <stoyanr> does it mean "the **sum** of the vertical distances" or "the vertical distance of **each point**"?

[12:07] <z4nt4> HI there, I just wanted to ask a question about the Stock Analysis question for the code slam. Are we given inputs in sorted (increasing) order, and guaranteed to have all days given a value? So if N is a value of 100, should we expect the pairs to go from (1, y1).... (100, y100)?

[12:32] <pbl64k> 'solved' means you've 'passed' all the cases
[12:32] <pbl64k> which means your solution is 'valid' in some sense, but that doesn't mean you've scored any points
[12:33] <pbl64k> you get 1/(L - 1) on SA
[12:33] <pbl64k> so you could get a 'correct' solution consisting of Nbig line segments, which would be 0.00 points when rounded to two significant digits

[13:39] <acb> and no one is trying to help

[16:18] <pedrosorio_> todor_bonchev nope
[16:19] <z4nt4> gpsinghsandhu1: but according to https://sap.interviewstreet.com/challenges/dashboard/#discuss/question/40/Requirements-of-line-segments there's more to this question than we're being told
[16:19] <z4nt4> we have to predict some 'trend' but nobody knows how to define a trend
[16:19] <pedrosorio_> todor_bonchev your first line has an absolute deviation greater than 3
[16:20] <pedrosorio_> z4nt4 I believe the challenge is mathematically well-posed

[16:20] <pedrosorio_> actually the statement could be modified to say
[16:20] <pedrosorio_> instead of
[16:20] <pedrosorio_> "A line segment is said to represent a set of prices for some consecutive days if the vertical distances (y-distance) of the points from that line is less than a given parameter D."
[16:20] <gpsinghsandhu1> ok the distances need to be added for individual points

[16:21] <pedrosorio_> (...) if the SUM of the vertical distances of the points (...)
[16:21] <z4nt4> ... really?
[16:21] <z4nt4> wow
[16:22] <pedrosorio_> z4nt4, yep simple linear regression that's all you are required to do
[16:22] <pedrosorio_> the most common metric is the sum of the squared distances
[16:22] <z4nt4> I was comparing each point's y value against the line's y value for that particular X position
[16:22] <pedrosorio_> in this case it's the sum of the absolute deviations, that's all
[16:23] <z4nt4> so for (3, 4), i would compare 4 against the y value of my line at y = 3
[16:23] <pedrosorio_> at x=3*
[16:23] <z4nt4> right
[16:23] <z4nt4> so you're saying we're supposed to SUM all of the distances?
[16:23] <pedrosorio_> yep, do that, but sum all the distances
[16:23] <z4nt4> alright...
[16:23] <pedrosorio_> z4nt4, that's fairly clear from the example case, I believe

[16:28] <pedrosorio_> vivmbbs we're saying too much "in public"?
[16:28] <pedrosorio_> sorry, if that's the case
[16:28] <@vivmbbs> nope
[16:28] <@vivmbbs> if you had some concerns/queries with the question, happy to answer
[16:29] <pedrosorio_> I think there's a misunderstanding about the meaning of parameter D
[16:29] <z4nt4> haha i agree
[16:29] <pedrosorio_> judging by what people are writing here
[16:29] <vemtaai_> indeed
[16:29] <@vivmbbs> what's the misunderstanding
[16:29] <pedrosorio_> the *sum* of y-distances for all points in a line, must be smaller than D
[16:30] <pedrosorio_> OR
[16:30] <pedrosorio_> each y-distance must be smaller than D
[16:30] <pedrosorio_> ?
[16:30] <z4nt4> yeah... that's the big question
[16:30] <pedrosorio_> (I believe it's the former, but it's not absolutely clear from the problem statement)
[16:31] <z4nt4> I was under the impression that this line is a sort of best-fit line, so as long as all points are within D units y of the line, then it would be okay... but with that I can only get 1.02 score
[16:31] <@vivmbbs> each should be less than D
[16:31] <@vivmbbs> i'll update the problem statement as well
[16:31] <z4nt4> if that's the case, then can you clear up what you mean about "trends"
[16:32] <R0mai> Either way, the original function as the approximation should be a correct answer (albeit for a low score). right?
[16:32] <vemtaai_> also, why is the trivial solution (ie. output the original) only accepted in 2/4 testcases?
[16:33] <@vivmbbs> because there are a number of different test-cases for the problem
[16:33] <@vivmbbs> and it's not necessary that the hidden test-cases are sample test-cases as well
[16:33] <z4nt4> if we're not meant to just describe the example case with an upwards spike, then a downwards spike, what makes the last 3 flat points form a trend in the example, whereas the first pair of flat points at x = 4 and x = 5 do not form a trend
[16:34] <z4nt4> basically, why must the example case use 3 lines rather than just 2, if we only follow the restriction of D

[16:43] <@vivmbbs> checking
[16:44] <z4nt4> the problem is that the distance from the line to 7, 4 is exactly 3
[16:44] <z4nt4> and D = 3
[16:44] <z4nt4> so we have to stay less than D, so that one fails

[17:11] <sidhant13> is the "score=1/L" also included in the output
[17:11] <@vivmbbs> no
[17:11] <@vivmbbs> can you please refresh the page?
[17:11] <@vivmbbs> i've put up that statement below

[17:13] <sidhant13> for D=3, output according to me is not correct
[17:15] <pedrosorio> score 0
[17:15] <pedrosorio> hmmm
[17:15] <z4nt4> refresh :)
[17:16] <pedrosorio> z4nt4 refresh what?
[17:16] <z4nt4> your submissions page
[17:16] <z4nt4> still score 0?
[17:16] <todor_bonchev> so we must write to the output L like is said in the statement and not L-1, cuz i get 1.02 points when i write L-1
[17:17] <@vivmbbs> the first line is the number of points
[17:17] <pedrosorio> yep still score 0
[17:17] <@vivmbbs> if there are L points, there are L-1 lines
[17:17] <@vivmbbs> and the score is 1/L-1
[17:17] <@vivmbbs> pedrosorio, checking
[17:17] <pedrosorio> I think the feedback in the activity page doesn't help a lot
[17:17] <pedrosorio> it says 3/4
[17:17] <sidhant13> Can anyone plz tell what shud be the output of sample case
[17:17] * vivmbbs is checking the approximate algorithm checker. Request you to wait for 10-15 mins
[17:18] <sidhant13> accroding to me it shud be
[17:18] <sidhant13> 3
[17:18] <sidhant13> 1 2
[17:18] <sidhant13> 6 5
[17:18] <sidhant13> 10 3
[17:18] * vemtaai thanks vivmbbs' continued work in the matter
[17:18] <sidhant13> but the test and run is showing the "wrong answer"
[17:20] <pedrosorio> sidhant13 I think it's supposed to show wrong answer: "NOTE: Compile & Test won't work for approximate algorithm problems. Please submit your answers directly."
[17:22] <pedrosorio> also, could you guys give us feedback on the scoring method for the truck delivery problem?
[17:23] <@vivmbbs> what feedback would you like to have?
[17:26] <@vivmbbs> z4nt4, pedrosorio and everyone else - can you please try submitting now?
[17:27] <pedrosorio> the problem states that we should try to achieve the least cost
[17:27] <blablabla> will there be any rejudge?
[17:27] <pedrosorio> but it doesn't say what we can expect the score to be
[17:27] <pedrosorio> (like max 5 in the case of the stock problem)
[17:27] <z4nt4> resubmitted
[17:27] <z4nt4> printing L,   2/4 cases
[17:27] <blablabla> when the output checker is fully corrected?
[17:28] <@vivmbbs> there's nothing to be rejudged. you can submit again
[17:28] <@vivmbbs> pedrosorio, i don't think so. since even I don't know the optimal solution for the cost
[17:29] <pedrosorio> vivmbbs, sure but the "good" scores for the delivery problem
[17:29] <pedrosorio> are similar to the ones for the stock problem?
[17:29] <R0mai> Then follows N-1 lines each containing 4 integers, x y d p [...]   : p is not an integer
[17:30] <@vivmbbs> not sure
[17:30] <@vivmbbs> R0mai, fixing
[17:30] <R0mai> thanks
[17:30] <pedrosorio> vivmbbs score 0 again
[17:30] <pedrosorio> hmm

[17:36] <pedrosorio> I get 0.5
[17:36] <pedrosorio> not great :P
[17:36] <z4nt4> haha same
[17:36] <contradictioned> contradictioned: ah thanks. that enlightened my whole process of... holistic.. stuff..
[17:36] <blablabla> got 0.5 too
[17:37] <@vivmbbs> yes
[17:37] <contradictioned> jana1: holistic^^
[17:37] <@vivmbbs> 1/(3-1)
[17:37] <contradictioned> did you now 0.8 was an integer?
[17:37] <jana1> contradictioned: for sure
[17:37] <contradictioned> 4 is sure an integer ;)
[17:37] <pedrosorio> vivmbbs yeah, but since the "best" would be 5
[17:37] <pedrosorio> 0.5 is pretty bad
[17:37] <pedrosorio> :P
[17:37] <contradictioned> but 0.5 is an int anyway :)
[17:38] <jana1> true story
[17:38] <z4nt4> its actually  0.517241
[17:39] <blablabla> z4nt4, I also got 0.517241 too
[17:39] <z4nt4> so the first line is supposed to be L for sure right?

[17:40] <sidhant13> how it arrived at "0.51"
[17:40] <z4nt4> sidhant13: it says at the bottom of the problem statement

[17:41] <sidhant13> what is l
[17:41] <pedrosorio> sidhant13 the number of points you output
[17:41] <z4nt4> The first line of output should contain L , L-1 is the number of representative lines. Next L lines should contain two integers, xi yi, each. For each i, such that 1 <= i < L, (xi, yi)->(xi+1, yi+1) is a representative line. x1 = 1, xL = N,  1 <= xi <= N.
[17:41] <z4nt4> it's all on the problem statement

[21:23] <maddoob> Hello guys!
[21:23] <maddoob> I have a question about the task Stock Analysis. Here it is. If the distance D is equal to 3, as in an example. It would be possible to solve the problem only with two lines - middle point at 5, 6

[21:24] <@vivmbbs> yes
[21:24] <maddoob> so the example output in the description is incorrect?
[21:24] <@vivmbbs> it's just an example
[21:25] <maddoob> ok thanks

[21:31] <yzaikin> hello. is it possible to see the score of the solution for each individual test case?

[21:31] <Artox> <maddoob> I have a question about the task Stock Analysis. Here it is. If the distance D is equal to 3
[21:32] <Artox> the text says less than 3
[21:32] <Artox> so may distance be equal D too?

[21:40] <pelka> "less than" means less, therefore not equal
[21:40] <Artox> just like integer meant float ealier today
[21:43] <@vivmbbs> Artox, i'm sorry about it. I understand you're very frustrated and hence the comment. but this is a new type of problem and we're ironing out all possible issues
[21:43] <@vivmbbs> sorry
[21:44] <Artox> so it is really less than meant

[21:57] <g4ur4v_> for me solved status say 1 but score =0
[21:57] <g4ur4v_> what does that mean ?

[21:59] <hari_> g4ur4v_, hi, the solved status can be ignored.
[22:01] <pedrosorio> interesting issue... why is the score for stocks 1/(L-1)?
[22:01] <pedrosorio> intuitively, cases with big N will have larger L and thus a small score
[22:01] <pedrosorio> but I may be wrong
